The RARAA project addresses the challenge of making semantically structured archaeological data more accessible and reusable. Although the RDF dataset was already published and aligned with established ontologies, access to this information remained limited to users with technical expertise. This study aimed to overcome that barrier by designing and implementing a web-based interface that allows non-expert users to explore, filter, and interpret motifs from Vale do Côa using SPARQL queries. By bridging the gap between complex RDF structures and practical research needs, the system contributes to the broader goals of the RARAA project, offering a scalable and reusable model for cultural heritage data visualization.
